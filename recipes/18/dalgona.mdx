- 1 Tbsp instant coffee (I used Moccona vanilla praline and itâ€™s super tasty!)
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp hot water
- 3/4 cup to 1 cup milk (your choice), chilled or heated
- (optional) ice cubes

1. Combine instant coffee, sugar and hot water in a mixing bowl. Mix them well. Then using a handheld mixer (stand mixer or milk frother) whisk it on high speed until the coffee mixture forms a stiff peak (2-4 mins).
2. Add the ice cubes in a mug then pour over the milk. Scoop out the whipped coffee on top of the milk. Serve.
