- 185g/6.5 ounces canned tuna, well-drained
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 30g/1 ounce green onions, finely chopped
- 45g/1.6 ounces onion, finely diced
- 20g/0.7 ounces red bell peppers or cayenne chili, seed removed & finely diced
- 20g/0.7 ounces green bell peppers or cayenne chili, seed removed & finely diced
- (optional) 1 Tbsp mayonnaise (I used Hellmann’s brand)
- 2 tsp all purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- A few sprinkles of ground black pepper
- Some cooking oil (I used rice bran oil)

1. Make the dipping sauce by whisking all the dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine all the prepared main ingredients (excluding the oil) in a mixing bowl and mix them well.
2. Preheat a skillet over medium-low heat and once heated add some cooking oil across the pan. Scoop out the tuna mixture with a spoon (heaped), and gently place it onto the pan (each spoonful mixture makes one pancake). Cook for 2-3 mins. Flip them over and cook another 2-3 mins, or until golden brown. You can also tell it is ready when no egg liquid seeps out when you gently press the mixture down with a spatula.
3. Remove from the pan when both sides of the pancake are cooked. Repeat this until all the remaining mixture is used up. You may need to add more cooking oil between the batches.
4. Serve.
