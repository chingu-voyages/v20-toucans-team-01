- 600g/1.3 pounds pork shoulder (pork collar butt), cut into small pieces for stir frying (\*see note)
- 1 medium onion (170g/6 ounces), julienned
- Some cooking oil (I used [rice bran oil](http://amzn.to/2byyZPn))
- 30g/1 ounce green onion, chopped
- 1 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds

### Pork Bulgogi Marinade (Blend these together in a handheld mixer or food processor)

- 100g/3.5 ounces red apple (e.g. royal gala) or nashi pear
- 50g/1.8 ounces brown onion
- 3 Tbsp [gochujang](http://amzn.to/2b5S5xK) (Korean chilli paste)
- 3 Tbsp [soy sauce](http://amzn.to/2byCeGc)
- 3 Tbsp honey (or brown sugar)
- 2 Tbsp [gochugaru](http://amzn.to/2byCDZq) (Korean chilli flakes)
- 2 Tbsp [rice wine](http://amzn.to/2b8WvTp) (mirin)
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 Tbsp minced ginger
- 1/8 tsp ground black pepper

1. Marinate the meat in the sauce for at least 30 minutes.
2. In a well-heated wok or skillet cook the marinated meat over medium-high heat until the meat is about 70% cooked (about 7 to 10 mins). Add the onion and cook further until the meat is completely cooked. Garnish with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve the meat with steamed rice, fresh lettuce, and Korean spicy dipping sauce.
