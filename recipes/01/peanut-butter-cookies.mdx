2. In a large bowl, mix together the peanut butter, sugar, and egg.
3. Scoop out a spoonful of dough and roll it into a ball.
4. Place the cookie balls onto a nonstick baking sheet.
5. For extra decoration and to make them cook more evenly, flatten the cookie balls by pressing a fork down on top of them, then press it down again at a 90º angle to make a criss-cross pattern.
6. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown.
