- 500g /1.1 pounds chicken thigh fillets (you can use a whole chicken or chicken breast instead), cut into bite size pieces
- 1/2 medium sweet potato (180g/6.3 ounces), cut into long thick sticks (like English chips)
- 1/2 small carrot (60g/2.1 ounces), diagonally sliced
- 1/4 small cabbage (320g/0.7 pounds), shredded
- 10 [Korean perilla leaves](http://amzn.to/22KhG5G) (35g/1.2 ounces), thinly sliced
- 18 fresh [Korean rice cakes](http://amzn.to/1ZI7J3g) pieces (175g/ 6.1 ounces), separated, if you use pre-packaged rice cakes, separate them first then soak in warm water for 10 minutes before you use them.
- Some cooking oil (2 to 3 Tbsp) – I used [rice bran oil](http://amzn.to/1q1PGsa)

### MARINADE SAUCE

- 3 Tbsp [gochujang](http://amzn.to/1Tg7E6b) (Korean chili paste)
- 2 Tbsp [rice wine](http://amzn.to/1RHsIwR)
- 1 Tbsp [gochugaru](http://amzn.to/25tZ5cT) (Korean chili flakes)
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp raw sugar
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp [Korean curry powder](https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-curry-powder/)
- 1/2 small onion (35g/1.2 ounces), grated or minced
- A few sprinkles of ground black pepper

1. Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix them well. Pour the sauce over the chopped chicken and marinate for at least 30 mins. (Though I strongly recommend marinating it for at least 4 hrs, and if you can afford more time, for overnight for better flavored chicken. However if you are really short of time, 30 mins is OK.)
2. Preheat a large skillet on medium high heat and once heated add some cooking oil. Put all the vegetables and rice cakes into the skillet and add the meat on top. Cook them on medium high heat for 3-4 mins. Then reduce the heat to medium to medium low and cook further until all is cooked (about 10 – 15 mins). During cooking, stir often to avoid food sticking onto the pan. You can cover with a lid to speed up the cooking process.
3. Serve with rice and other [Korean side dishes](https://mykoreankitchen.com/category/side-dishes-banchan/) (optional).
