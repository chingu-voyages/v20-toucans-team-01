- 3/4 pound boneless chicken thighs (may be substituted with chicken breasts or tenderloin)
- 2 tablespoons [sake](https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-tips-for-drinking-sake-2031154)
- 4 tablespoon [soy sauce](https://www.thespruceeats.com/types-of-chinese-soy-sauce-694628)
- 4 tablespoons [mirin](https://www.thespruceeats.com/mirin-2031388) (sweet sake)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- Pinch of grated ginger (add more to taste)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil for cooking chicken (may be substituted with canola or other oil)

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Poke chicken using a fork to help absorb the flavors of the teriyaki sauce during cooking.
3. Make the teriyaki sauce. In a large bowl, combine sake, soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and ginger and mix well.
4. Add chicken to the bowl and marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for 15 minutes in the refrigerator.
5. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Place the chicken skin side down into the skillet, cooking the skin of the chicken first, until the skin is browned.
6. Flip the chicken over to cook the other side, but reduce the heat to low.
7. Pour the teriyaki sauce that was used to marinate the chicken into the skillet. Cover the skillet with a lid and steam cook the chicken on low heat until done, and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 F and juices run clear.
8. Remove the lid and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly. There is no need to add potato starch or cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Remove the pan from the heat.
9. Slice the chicken and serve on a plate. Pour the remaining thickened teriyaki sauce over the chicken.
10. Optional: If you like, garnish the teriyaki chicken with additional grated ginger.
