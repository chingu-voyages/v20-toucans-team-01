- 8 fresh or frozen komochi shishamo (smelt with roe)
- Cooking spray
- Grated daikon (Japanese radish)
- Garnish: soy sauce (season to taste)

1. Rinse shishamo gently with water. Pat dry with a paper towel. If it’s frozen, thaw the fish first, prior to grilling.
2. Spray canola oil on a grill pan.
3. Over medium-high heat, gently grill fish on each side about 4 to 5 minutes until browned. If you prefer the skin of the fish to be more on the crisp side, grill a few minutes longer to taste. When turning the fish over, be very careful as the fish are delicate and can easily break apart. The skin of the fish is also very thin and if it happens to break open slightly when cooking, it’s natural, and there’s no need to worry.
4. Grate Japanese daikon radish and serve this on the side, seasoning the radish and fish with soy sauce to taste.
