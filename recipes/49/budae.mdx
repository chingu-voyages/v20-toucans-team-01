- 30g (1 ounces) green onion, thinly & diagonally sliced
- 1 or 2 slices of cheese

### Sauce (Mix these in a small bowl)

- 2 Tbsp [Korean chili flakes](http://amzn.to/1VDSS7F) (Gochugaru)
- 2 Tbsp [rice wine](http://amzn.to/1RmH2O0) (mirin)
- 1 Tbsp [soy sauce](http://amzn.to/1T6qtcY)

- A few sprinkles of ground black pepper

1. Assemble the main ingredients (except for instant ramen noodles, rice cakes, green onion and cheese) in a [shallow pot](http://amzn.to/1WIuQZA). Add the sauce in the middle. Pour the stock in the corner of the pot. Close the lid and boil it on medium high heat until the stock starts to boil (about 8 mins).
2. Add the remaining ingredients – instant ramen noodles, rice cakes, green onion and cheese on top of the pot and boil uncovered until the noodles are cooked (about 2 to 3 mins). Reduce the heat to low (if you’re cooking on a portable burner and sharing the food at the dinning table).
3. Start dishing out soup, protein, and vegetables onto your own soup bowl. Serve with steamed rice
