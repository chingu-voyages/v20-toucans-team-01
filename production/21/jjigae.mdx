- 110g/3.9 ounces littleneck clams, cleaned
- 3 medium banana prawns (80g/2.8 ounces), head, shells and guts removed
- 100g/3.5 ounces enoki mushrooms, bottom 4-5 cm stem removed and rinsed briefly in cold running water
- 45g/1.6 ounces oyster mushrooms or [shimeji mushrooms](http://www.earthy.com/Fresh-Organic-Brown-Clamshell-Hon-Shimeji-Mushrooms-from-Earthy-Delights.aspx), rinsed and separated by hand
- 2 small shiitake mushrooms (20g/ 0.7 ounces), cleaned, stem removed and thinly sliced

- 1 stalk of spring onion (10g/0.4 ounces), diagonally thinly sliced

### SOUP BASE

- 1 1/2 cups [dried kelp and anchovy stock](https://mykoreankitchen.com/how-to-make-korean-style-dashi/)
- 1/2 Tbsp cooking oil – I used [rice bran oil](http://amzn.to/1OmQoqa)
- 1 Tbsp [Korean chilli flakes](http://amzn.to/1YkVB7n) (gochugaru)
- 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1/2 tsp soy sauce
- 3/4 tsp fine sea salt (or more to taste)
- A few sprinkles of ground black pepper
- A dash (about 1/2 tsp) of [sesame oil](http://amzn.to/1T3F1c0)

1. Put the cooking oil, chili flakes, garlic and soy sauce into a pot. Heat the pot on the stove on medium low heat and stir the spices well for 1 min. Make sure not to burn the chilli powder.
2. Add the clams and shrimps and stir quickly to coat them with the chilli sauce.
3. Add the dried kelp and anchovy stock and boil it on medium to medium-high heat until it starts to boil rapidly (2 to 3 mins). Add the salt and stir.
4. Add the tofu, in big chunks, mushrooms, and egg and cook them for another 1 to 2 mins.
5. Top up with the green onion, black pepper and sesame oil. Serve hot with [Korean rice](https://mykoreankitchen.com/how-to-make-perfect-korean-steamed-rice-step-3-how-to-soak-and-cook-the-rice/) and [side dishes (banchan)](https://mykoreankitchen.com/the-banchan-cookbook/).
