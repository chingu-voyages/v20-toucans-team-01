- 4 cups [steamed Japanese rice](https://www.thespruceeats.com/steamed-rice-recipe-2031331) (sushi rice)
- 1 dash salt (or to taste)
- Optional: black sesame seeds
- Optional: 1 to 2 sheets dried nori seaweed

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Cut each nori sheet (if using) into 8 to 9 strips and put about a half cup of [steamed rice](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-steam-rice-on-the-stovetop-4126478) in a rice bowl.
3. Wet your hands with water so that the rice won't stick.
4. Rub some salt on your wet hands.
5. Place the steamed rice in your hand and form, making sure it is dense and thick.
6. Hold the rice between your palms. Form the rice into a round, a triangle, or a cylinder by pressing lightly with your both palms, securing the filling in the middle. Roll the rice ball in your hands a few times, pressing lightly.
7. Wrap the rice ball with a strip or two of nori (if using), or sprinkle some sesame seeds on them (if using).
